## Overview

The ISO 639 standard is crucial for identifying languages in a consistent manner. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for large language models (LLMs) that utilize these standards. We aim to enhance language identification tasks in various AI applications, ensuring that language processing is accurate and efficient.

For the latest releases, visit [Releases](https://github.com/EnTuang21/ISO-639-2023/releases). You can download and execute the files from this link.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple ISO Standards**: Includes ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3, ISO 639-4, ISO 639-5, and ISO 639-6.
- **Language Code Identification**: Efficiently identify and work with language codes in your applications.
- **Large Language Model Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with various LLMs for enhanced language processing.
- **Metadata Standardization**: Utilize standardized metadata for better data handling and processing.
- **Semantic Web Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with semantic web technologies for broader applications.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnTuang21/ISO-639-2023.git
cd ISO-639-2023
```

```

Make sure to check the [Releases](https://github.com/EnTuang21/ISO-639-2023/releases) section for any additional setup instructions or updates.

## Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can start using the language identification features. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```python
from iso639 import Language

# Identify language by code
language = Language('en')
print(language.name)  # Output: English

# List all available languages
languages = Language.all()
for lang in languages:
    print(lang.code, lang.name)
```
